Lab Assignment 1 (303852)

### i. App name + description

App Name: Pet Food Planner  
Description: Simple application that helps user to estimate daily food intake of their pets based on weight, type and their activity level. It have a splash screen, input validation and also easy to use interface.


### ii. Inputs → Process → Output Operation

**Inputs:**
- Weight (kg)
- Age (years)
- Type (Cat / Dog) –> selected using a dropdown menu
- Activity Level (Not Active / Active / Very Active) –> selected using a dropdown menu

**Process:**
- When the user presses Calculate button, the app validates inputs to ensure they are positive numbers
- Based on the pet type and activity level, the app applies a foodIntake value to calculate food needs.  
  Example: Cats (30 – 40 foodIntake), Dogs (40 – 60 foodIntake)
- The formula used:  
  Recommended Food = Weight × foodIntake
  
**Output:**
- Displays the recommended food amount in grams per day
- If inputs is invalid, a red error message will appears 
- Reset button to clear all fields and restore defaults view

### iii. Widget List Used

- Text ->	Displays labels and messages  
- TextField ->	Accepts numeric inputs of weight and age  
- DropdownButton -> Pet type and activity selection  
- ElevatedButton -> Perform Calculate and Reset functions  
- Row -> Arrange labels and input widgets horizontally  
- Column ->	Stacking widgets vertically  
- Container ->	Groups and styles the main input and output area  
- SizedBox ->	Add spaces between ui elements  
- AppBar ->	Displays the page title on top  
- Scaffold ->	Provides page structure  
- SingleChildScrollView ->	Prevents overflow when keyboard appears  
- Icon ->	Used in splash screen (paws icon)  
- CircularProgressIndicator ->	Splash screen animation (simulating loading)


### iv. Basic Validation Approach

- The app assumes valid numeric input since number only keyboards are used for weight and age fields.
- Before calculation, the program checks if any input field is empty.
- If weight or age is missing or ≤ 0:  
  “message” variable displays an inline red warning text.  
  Food amount will be set back to 0.  
- The UI updates dynamically using setState(() {}) whenever inputs or outputs change.
